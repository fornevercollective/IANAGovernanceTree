# ZIP Preparation Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to prepare the Internet Infrastructure Explorer project for download as a ZIP file and subsequent implementation on GitHub.

## Creating the ZIP File

### Preferred Method: Using GitHub's Download ZIP Feature

1. Once the repository is hosted on GitHub, navigate to your repository page
2. Click on the "Code" button (green button)
3. Select "Download ZIP"
4. This will download the entire repository as a ZIP file with the correct structure

### Alternative Method: Manual ZIP Creation

If you need to create the ZIP file manually:

1. Ensure all the required files are present in your project directory:
   ```
   ├── App.tsx
   ├── components/
   ├── lib/
   ├── styles/
   ├── public/
   ├── package.json
   ├── vite.config.ts
   ├── tailwind.config.js
   ├── index.html
   ├── main.tsx
   ├── README.md
   ├── .gitignore
   └── ... (other files)
   ```

2. Using a file explorer:
   - Select all the files and folders in your project directory
   - Right-click and select "Compress" or "Create archive" (options vary by operating system)
   - Save the ZIP file with a descriptive name (e.g., `internet-infrastructure-explorer.zip`)

3. Using the command line:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/MacOS
   zip -r internet-infrastructure-explorer.zip .

   # On Windows (using PowerShell)
   Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath internet-infrastructure-explorer.zip
   ```

## ZIP File Structure

Ensure the ZIP file has the following structure when extracted:

```
internet-infrastructure-explorer/
├── App.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── AdvancedAnalysis.tsx
│   ├── FlowVisualization.tsx
│   ├── ... (other components)
├── lib/
│   └── mockData.ts
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── tailwind.config.js
├── index.html
├── main.tsx
├── README.md
├── DEPLOYMENT.md
├── GITHUB_IMPLEMENTATION.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Implementation After Download

After downloading and extracting the ZIP file:

1. Follow the instructions in the GITHUB_IMPLEMENTATION.md file to set up the project on GitHub
2. Follow the instructions in the README.md file for local development
3. Follow the instructions in the DEPLOYMENT.md file for deployment options

## Troubleshooting Common ZIP Issues

### Missing Files

If files appear to be missing after extracting the ZIP:
- Check if hidden files (like .gitignore) were extracted
- Check if the extraction created an extra parent directory

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues:
- On MacOS/Linux, use `chmod -R 755 ./internet-infrastructure-explorer` to set appropriate permissions
- On Windows, right-click on the folder, select Properties, then the Security tab, and ensure you have full control

### Large ZIP File Size

If the ZIP file is too large:
- Ensure node_modules is not included in the ZIP file
- Exclude any build artifacts (dist/, build/, etc.)
- Exclude any IDE-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)

## Conclusion

With the ZIP file properly prepared, users can easily download, extract, and implement the Internet Infrastructure Explorer project on their own GitHub repositories and development environments.
