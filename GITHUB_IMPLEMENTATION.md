# GitHub Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Internet Infrastructure Explorer on GitHub.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "internet-infrastructure-explorer")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose public or private visibility
6. Initialize with a README (optional)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/internet-infrastructure-explorer.git
cd internet-infrastructure-explorer
```

### 3. Download and Extract Project Files

1. Download the ZIP file containing the Internet Infrastructure Explorer
2. Extract the contents into your cloned repository
3. Your directory structure should look like:
   ```
   ├── App.tsx
   ├── components/
   ├── lib/
   ├── styles/
   ├── public/
   ├── package.json
   ├── vite.config.ts
   ├── tailwind.config.js
   ├── index.html
   ├── main.tsx
   ├── README.md
   ├── .gitignore
   └── ...
   ```

### 4. Initialize the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Make sure the project compiles
npm run build

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 5. Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Internet Infrastructure Explorer"
git push origin main
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### 1. Install GitHub Pages Package

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

### 2. Update package.json

Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/internet-infrastructure-explorer",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will create a `gh-pages` branch in your repository and deploy your built application there.

### 4. Configure GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "gh-pages" branch and the root folder
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait a few minutes for your site to be published
7. Access your site at the URL shown in the GitHub Pages section

## Setting Up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### 1. Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
        
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: dist
```

### 2. Commit and Push the Workflow

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for deployment"
git push origin main
```

This will automatically trigger the workflow which will build and deploy your application to GitHub Pages.

### 3. Monitor Workflow Status

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. You should see your workflow running or completed
4. Once completed successfully, your application will be deployed to GitHub Pages

## Conclusion

Your Internet Infrastructure Explorer is now set up on GitHub with automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. Any changes you push to the main branch will automatically be built and deployed.

You can access your application at `https://yourusername.github.io/internet-infrastructure-explorer`.
